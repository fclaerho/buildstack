**Build** is a build stack wrapper, its goal is to allow you to handle the build process
of any source code repository: all build stacks follow the same patterns but all have
specific invocation details, focus on the big picture and let **Build** handle the details.

Example:

	$ git pull ${somewhere}/${somerepo}.git
	$ cd ${somerepo}
	$ build clean -a test compile package

For usage and development details, please check out the inline help: `build -h`

EXTRA FEATURES
--------------

  * Generate configuration files (`build configure â€¦`):
    * ansible
    * nose2, enable xunit standard, useful with Jenkins reporting
    * pypi, to use a private repository
  * Python:
    * use `build package -f pkg` to build native OS/X packages.
    * on testing, if nose2.cfg is present and setup.py does not use it, the original setup.py will be backed up and a new one will be generated to call nose2.
  * Ansible Galaxy:
    * publish your roles to a private http server (e.g. nginx + dav module).
    * Install the dependencies with galaxy from requirements.yml
